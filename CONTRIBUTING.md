Right now I am not looking for help with this project. That said, if you feel
strongly about wanting to contribute, I am open to it. Please email me at
adamzerner@protonmail.com and we can talk. Also, if there are smaller, obvious
improvements to make, feel free to just open a PR.

Down the road I might be interested in having more contributors.
