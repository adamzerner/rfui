I'm mostly not looking for help with this project. That said, if you feel
strongly about wanting to contribute, I am open to it. Please email me at
adamzerner@protonmail.com and we can talk. Also, if there are smaller, obvious
improvements to make, feel free to just open a PR.

Down the road I might be interested in having more contributors.

Some specific things I welcome contributions for:

- Tutorials like the current Fresh and Remix tutorials, but for other web
  frameworks.
- Help with anything in the "Blocked" column of the
  [roadmap](https://github.com/users/adamzerner/projects/2).
- Figuring out a way to remove the dependency on Prism
  ([task](https://github.com/adamzerner/rfui/issues/167)).
- Help with compressing `rfui.css`
  ([task](https://github.com/users/adamzerner/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=51325810)).
