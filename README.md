# Overview

Webite: https://rfui.deno.dev/

This is a component library that is currently intended to be used on projects
using Deno's web framework [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) and is built
according to the following
[philosophical principles](https://rfui.deno.dev/philosophy).

1. Opinionated
2. Scale down
3. Limit your choices
4. Prioritize documentation
5. Pit of success (eg. by providing tips and references to best practices, and
   by prefixing with underscores)
6. Pretty
7. Use the platform
8. Pareto solutions > high customizability

# Notes

It is currently in a very early stage. See the
[project page](https://github.com/users/adamzerner/projects/2/views/1).

It follows the
[Atomic Design Methodlogy](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) by
breaking components into "atoms", "molecules" and "organisms".
