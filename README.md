# Overview

The goal of this project is to have a component library that I can use that is
inspired by the book [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/).

It is currently in a very early stage. See the
[project page](https://github.com/users/adamzerner/projects/2/views/1).

I am following the
[Atomic Design Methodlogy](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) by
breaking components into "atoms", "molecules" and organisms.

## Versioning

To create a new version of this library:

- Use https://github.com/adamzerner/rfui/releases/new
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
